abstract = {Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have emerged in recent years in response to studies showing the benefits of undergraduate research internships and to national calls to engage many more STEM undergraduates in doing research. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge about CURE instruction, including shortcomings in the knowledge base and recommendations for future research and practice. CUREs are distinctive as learning environments because they afford students opportunities to make discoveries that are of interest to the broader scientific community or other stakeholders outside the classroom. CUREs also engage students in iterative work, during which they repeat and build on aspects of their own and others' work in order to ensure the trustworthiness of their findings and generate meaningful scientific knowledge. Communication and collaboration are thought to be important elements of effective CUREs, but the importance of producing scientific publications versus other meaningful products remains an area of debate. Numerous student-, faculty-, and institution-level goals have driven CURE development, especially in the life sciences and chemistry. These goals include the desire to improve students' persistence and success in STEM and in college, to make research accessible to a larger and more diverse group of students, and integrate to the teaching and research efforts of faculty. Introductory-level CUREs are thought to exert greater influence students' educational and career trajectories, while upper-level CUREs are useful for to students confirm their interest in pursuing science-research related educational or career paths. Small-and large-scale CUREs have been developed that engage students in addressing common and diverse research questions. CUREs themselves vary widely in duration, costs, and operations. There are only a few published examples of CURE being implemented in two-year colleges or minority-serving institutions. Students who participate in CUREs develop content knowledge and technical skills specific to the area of research. They also develop confidence in their ability to do science and a sense of 2 ownership of their research. Few studies of CUREs to date make use of valid and reliable measures of student outcomes, or study designs and methods that control for student-level differences. Additional research is needed that makes use of theory and methods from the social sciences to more fully understand how CUREs operate, how students and faculty benefit from this unique learning environment, and how challenges to adopting, implementing, and sustaining CUREs can be overcome.},

@article{Flaherty2017,
abstract = {A new movement to develop course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) is emerging, although the benefits of such programs have not yet been fully evaluated. We examined effects of a field-based CURE project on science attitudes, career choice, and perceived knowledge of undergraduate wildlife students (n = 32) at the University of Wyoming in 2012. In this project, junior and senior students gained practical experience, used their own data to learn various modeling approaches, and disseminated results orally and in written form. We used a mixed-method study with pre- and postactivity surveys and focus group interviews to evaluate the change in student perceptions. Our results illustrate that participation in the CURE project resulted in benefits similar to those reported from traditional undergraduate research experience programs. Participants reported increased understanding of the scientific method, clarification of their career choices, and greater confidence in their perceived knowledge of science. These changes were more pronounced among male participants. Concurrently students gained valuable skills that are required by practicing wildlife biologists. Based on these results it appears that adoption of CURE projects in similar natural resources programs could provide a large number of undergraduate students with equivalent opportunities to those currently experienced by a select few through traditional undergraduate research experience programs. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

@article{Shortlidge2016,
abstract = {Integrating research experiences into undergraduate life sciences curricula in the form of course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) can meet national calls for education reform by giving students the chance to "do science." In this article, we provide a step-by-step practical guide to help instructors assess their CUREs using best practices in assessment. We recommend that instructors first identify their anticipated CURE learning outcomes, then work to identify an assessment instrument that aligns to those learning outcomes and critically evaluate the results from their course assessment. To aid instructors in becoming aware of what instruments have been developed, we have also synthesized a table of "off-the-shelf" assessment instruments that instructors could use to assess their own CUREs. However, we acknowledge that each CURE is unique and instructors may expect specific learning outcomes that cannot be assessed using existing assessment instruments, so we recommend that instructors consider developing their own assessments that are tightly aligned to the context of their CURE.},

@article{Kerr2016,
abstract = {A continuous effort within an undergraduate university setting is to improve students' learning outcomes and thus improve students' attitudes about a particular field of study. This is undoubtedly relevant within a chemistry laboratory. This paper reports the results of an effort to introduce a problem-based learning strategy into the analytical chemistry laboratory curricula at North Carolina Central University. This study involved a total of 48 science major students who were taking two analytical chemistry courses, namely Quantitative Chemical Analysis and Instrumental Analysis, spanning Fall 2011 to Spring 2015. Course-based undergraduate research experiences or CUREs have been systematically incorporated into the laboratory components of these two consecutive analytical courses in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters. Each CUREs project involved identifying a problem, locating an appropriate method via literature search, designing a study, collecting samples, measuring variables, analyzing data, and presenting the results in a formal report and an oral presentation. Our evaluation of the preliminary impacts of CUREs integration shows that the majority of students became more excited about careers in chemistry, and science in general, as an outcome of this exercise. This is evidenced by overwhelmingly positive feedback received from the student participants, as well as increased retention of upper-level science major students.},

@article{Corwin2015,
abstract = {Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are being championed as scalable ways of involving undergraduates in science research. Studies of CUREs have shown that participating students achieve many of the same outcomes as students who complete research internships. However, CUREs vary widely in their design and implementation, and aspects of CUREs that are necessary and sufficient to achieve desired student outcomes have not been elucidated. To guide future research aimed at understanding the causal mechanisms underlying CURE efficacy, we used a systems approach to generate pathway models representing hypotheses of how CURE outcomes are achieved. We started by reviewing studies of CUREs and research internships to generate a comprehensive set of outcomes of research experiences, determining the level of evidence supporting each outcome. We then used this body of research and drew from learning theory to hypothesize connections between what students do during CUREs and the outcomes that have the best empirical support. We offer these models as hypotheses for the CURE community to test, revise, elaborate, or refute. We also cite instruments that are ready to use in CURE assessment and note gaps for which instruments need to be developed.},

abstract = {Science education studies have shown that a sequence of course-based research experiences has many positive effects for undergraduates. To maximize those benefits, we created a training program for the instructors (aka Research Educators). The program guides them in how to move students early in their college years through the process of science such that students then can successfully apply their learning to conduct real research projects. The key to instructors' training is creating a supportive community of practice in which everyone participates, including by taking leading roles.},
