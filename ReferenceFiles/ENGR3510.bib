A wind tunnel experiments consists of physically testing the model in a simulated environment. It is a closed environment in which air is blown across the model at a constant velocity. As the air passes over the vehicle, it follows the streamlines pattern present on the body. This causes a change in pressure and velocity characteristics across the model. By studying the pressure and velocity variations across the model, the drag and lift coefficient could be predicted.},

abstract = {Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are being championed as scalable ways of involving undergraduates in science research. Studies of CUREs have shown that participating students achieve many of the same outcomes as students who complete research internships. However, CUREs vary widely in their design and implementation, and aspects of CUREs that are necessary and sufficient to achieve desired student outcomes have not been elucidated. To guide future research aimed at understanding the causal mechanisms underlying CURE efficacy, we used a systems approach to generate pathway models representing hypotheses of how CURE outcomes are achieved. We started by reviewing studies of CUREs and research internships to generate a comprehensive set of outcomes of research experiences, determining the level of evidence supporting each outcome. We then used this body of research and drew from learning theory to hypothesize connections between what students do during CUREs and the outcomes that have the best empirical support. We offer these models as hypotheses for the CURE community to test, revise, elaborate, or refute. We also cite instruments that are ready to use in CURE assessment and note gaps for which instruments need to be developed.},

abstract = {Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have emerged in recent years in response to studies showing the benefits of undergraduate research internships and to national calls to engage many more STEM undergraduates in doing research. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state of knowledge about CURE instruction, including shortcomings in the knowledge base and recommendations for future research and practice. CUREs are distinctive as learning environments because they afford students opportunities to make discoveries that are of interest to the broader scientific community or other stakeholders outside the classroom. CUREs also engage students in iterative work, during which they repeat and build on aspects of their own and others' work in order to ensure the trustworthiness of their findings and generate meaningful scientific knowledge. Communication and collaboration are thought to be important elements of effective CUREs, but the importance of producing scientific publications versus other meaningful products remains an area of debate. Numerous student-, faculty-, and institution-level goals have driven CURE development, especially in the life sciences and chemistry. These goals include the desire to improve students' persistence and success in STEM and in college, to make research accessible to a larger and more diverse group of students, and integrate to the teaching and research efforts of faculty. Introductory-level CUREs are thought to exert greater influence students' educational and career trajectories, while upper-level CUREs are useful for to students confirm their interest in pursuing science-research related educational or career paths. Small-and large-scale CUREs have been developed that engage students in addressing common and diverse research questions. CUREs themselves vary widely in duration, costs, and operations. There are only a few published examples of CURE being implemented in two-year colleges or minority-serving institutions. Students who participate in CUREs develop content knowledge and technical skills specific to the area of research. They also develop confidence in their ability to do science and a sense of 2 ownership of their research. Few studies of CUREs to date make use of valid and reliable measures of student outcomes, or study designs and methods that control for student-level differences. Additional research is needed that makes use of theory and methods from the social sciences to more fully understand how CUREs operate, how students and faculty benefit from this unique learning environment, and how challenges to adopting, implementing, and sustaining CUREs can be overcome.},

abstract = {The Kevlar-wall anechoic wind tunnel offers great value to the aeroacoustics research community, affording the capability to make simultaneous aeroacoustic and aerodynamic measurements. While the aeroacoustic potential of the Kevlar-wall test section is already being leveraged, the aerodynamic capability of these test sections is still to be fully realized. The flexibility of the Kevlar walls suggests the possibility that the internal test section flow may be characterized by precisely measuring small deflections of the flexible walls. Treating the Kevlar fabric walls as tensioned membranes with known pre-tension and material properties, an inverse stress problem arises where the pressure distribution over the wall is sought as a function of the measured wall deflection. Experimental wall deformations produced by the wind loading of an airfoil model are measured using digital image correlation and subsequently projected onto polynomial basis functions which have been formulated to mitigate the impact of measurement noise based on a finite-element study. Inserting analytic derivatives of the basis functions into the equilibrium relations for a membrane, full-field pressure distributions across the Kevlar walls are computed. These inversely calculated pressures, after being validated against an independent measurement technique, can then be integrated along the length of the test section to give the sectional lift of the airfoil. Notably, these first-time results are achieved with a non-contact technique and in an anechoic environment.},

abstract = {Measurements are presented of drag and lift on new tennis balls in flight. Two video cameras were used to measure the velocity and height of the balls at two positions separated horizontally by 6.4 m. The balls were fired from a ball launcher at speeds between 15 and 30 m/s and with topspin or backspin at rates up to 2,500 rpm. Significant shot-to-shot variations were found in both the drag and lift coefficients. The average drag coefficient was 0.507 ± 0.024, independent of ball speed or spin, and lower than the value usually observed in wind tunnel experiments. The lift coefficient increased with ball spin, on average, but significant lift was observed even at very low spin. The latter effect can be attributed to a side force arising from asymmetries in the ball surface, analogous to the side force responsible for the erratic path of a knuckleball in baseball. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Sports Engineering Association.},

abstract = {A new movement to develop course-based undergraduate research experiences (CURE) is emerging, although the benefits of such programs have not yet been fully evaluated. We examined effects of a field-based CURE project on science attitudes, career choice, and perceived knowledge of undergraduate wildlife students (n = 32) at the University of Wyoming in 2012. In this project, junior and senior students gained practical experience, used their own data to learn various modeling approaches, and disseminated results orally and in written form. We used a mixed-method study with pre- and postactivity surveys and focus group interviews to evaluate the change in student perceptions. Our results illustrate that participation in the CURE project resulted in benefits similar to those reported from traditional undergraduate research experience programs. Participants reported increased understanding of the scientific method, clarification of their career choices, and greater confidence in their perceived knowledge of science. These changes were more pronounced among male participants. Concurrently students gained valuable skills that are required by practicing wildlife biologists. Based on these results it appears that adoption of CURE projects in similar natural resources programs could provide a large number of undergraduate students with equivalent opportunities to those currently experienced by a select few through traditional undergraduate research experience programs. {\textcopyright} 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {A continuous effort within an undergraduate university setting is to improve students' learning outcomes and thus improve students' attitudes about a particular field of study. This is undoubtedly relevant within a chemistry laboratory. This paper reports the results of an effort to introduce a problem-based learning strategy into the analytical chemistry laboratory curricula at North Carolina Central University. This study involved a total of 48 science major students who were taking two analytical chemistry courses, namely Quantitative Chemical Analysis and Instrumental Analysis, spanning Fall 2011 to Spring 2015. Course-based undergraduate research experiences or CUREs have been systematically incorporated into the laboratory components of these two consecutive analytical courses in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 semesters. Each CUREs project involved identifying a problem, locating an appropriate method via literature search, designing a study, collecting samples, measuring variables, analyzing data, and presenting the results in a formal report and an oral presentation. Our evaluation of the preliminary impacts of CUREs integration shows that the majority of students became more excited about careers in chemistry, and science in general, as an outcome of this exercise. This is evidenced by overwhelmingly positive feedback received from the student participants, as well as increased retention of upper-level science major students.},

The effect of measurement plane size and grid resolution on the C Di calculations was also identified. The C Di estimated by the integral method was found to increase with increasing Re and was below the C Di = C l2 /$\pi$eAR prediction. Limits on the measurement plane size and grid resolution were determined to be at least 40{\%} larger than the vortex outside diameter and no larger than 0.63{\%} chord, respectively, in order to provide a good estimate of the induced drag. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

We recommend that instructors first identify their anticipated CURE learning outcomes, then work to identify an assessment instrument that aligns to those learning outcomes and critically evaluate the results from their course assessment. To aid instructors in becoming aware of what instruments have been developed, we have also synthesized a table of "off-the-shelf" assessment instruments that instructors could use to assess their own CUREs. However, we acknowledge that each CURE is unique and instructors may expect specific learning outcomes that cannot be assessed using existing assessment instruments, so we recommend that instructors consider developing their own assessments that are tightly aligned to the context of their CURE.},

To obtain real wind effects and loads, the experimental measurement in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT) in Bratislava has been prepared. The goal of an investigation is the determination of wind loads on permeable materials – plastic and steel fabric, using wind load reduction factor k. The mean wind pressure on the permeable material is obtained by multiplying the wind pressure to the impermeable surface by the reduction factor k depending on the Reynolds number. The experimentally determined reduction factor can be applied for design of the safety mesh fabric. Wind loads were obtained from measurement of wind velocity by Hot-Wire anemometry (HWA).},
